# VulkanBaseEngine

Template Vulkan engine to branch off into various projects 
I am interested in. I decided to take a very Object-Oriented 
direction with this engine as I think Vulkan objects lend 
themselves nicely to wrapper classes. However, I am still 
learning the best practices for C++. I will continue to add 
features and make improvements to the Base Engine branch as
they are needed in side projects.


## Projects On My Radar:
### Physics Simulations
* Fluid Simulation (2D and 3D)
* Rigid-Body Physics Engine
* Soft-Body Simulation
* Cloth Simulation

### Real-Time Rendering
* Optimized Instanced Rendering
* GPU Ray-Tracer

### Other
* glTF Loader
* Asset Manager/Loader
